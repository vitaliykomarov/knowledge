""" 
Note: for all these exercises, ignore input validation unless otherwise directed. 
Assume the user enters a value in the format that the program expects. 
For example, if the program expects the user to enter a number, 
don't worry about validating if the input is a number or not. 
When testing your program, simply enter a number.

5- Write a program and ask the user to enter a series of numbers separated by comma. 
Find the maximum of the numbers and display it on the console. 
For example, if the user enters â€œ5, 3, 8, 1, 4", the program should display 8.

numbers = input("Please enter a series of numbers separated by comma: ")

maxNum = numbersList[0]
for num in numbersList:
    if num > maxNum:
        maxNum = num
print("Max number will be:",maxNum)
